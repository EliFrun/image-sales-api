# RAILS IMAGE SALES API

This project aims to implement a rest api involving the following features

* adding and deleting users

* adding and deleting images

* facilitating the exchange of images between 2 users

* User retrieval

key assumptions:

* Users must upload images (no image is without an owner)

* images will be stored as links or hashes (in a real application an image would be BLOBed)
